"When displaying the content of a custom field, the widget evals an echo "
"command that simply outputs the content of the field.  If the Content "
"Generator field is present, the custom field content is loaded into the "
"variable $acfw_content and then the evald echo uses the string you put in "
"here as the basis for the widget content instead.  This allows you to "
"generate URL's and other content as the string $acfw_content is replaced by "
"the actual content from the post.  $data1-$data5 are loaded with the values "
"from the custom key specified by Additional Data Field 1 through 5, if "
"values exist in the post used as the data source.  You can also use $pageurl "
"which contains the URL of the post which was the source for the rest of the "
"widget content."
